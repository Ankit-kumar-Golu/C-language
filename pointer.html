        <h1>Pointer</h1>
        <p>The pointer in C language is a variable which stores the address of another variable. This variable can be of type int, char, array, function, or any other pointer. The size of the pointer depends on the architecture. However, in 32-bit architecture the size of a pointer is 2 byte.</p>
        <h2>Declaring a pointer</h2>
        <p>The pointer in c language can be declared using * (asterisk symbol). It is also known as indirection pointer used to dereference a pointer.</p>
        <p><b>int *a;//pointer to int <br> 
            char *c;//pointer to char  </b></p>
            <h3><span style="color:aqua;font-size: 30px;;background-color: aliceblue;"><u>Double Pointer (Pointer to Pointer)</u></span></h3>
            <p>As we know that, a pointer is used to store the address of a variable in C. Pointer reduces the access time of a variable. However, In C, we can also define a pointer to store the address of another pointer. Such pointer is known as a double pointer (pointer to pointer). The first pointer is used to store the address of a variable whereas the second pointer is used to store the address of the first pointer. Let's understand it by the diagram given below. </p>

            <p>The syntax of declaring a double pointer is given below.</p>
            <p><b>int **p;</b> // pointer to a pointer which is pointing to an integer.</p>
